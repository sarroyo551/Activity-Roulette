<!-- For our project, we decided to make an application for random activities and random jokes, where you can search an activity or random jokes and receive information about the song such as album, release date, length of song and more. This is our first API. When you are displayed with the information on the song card there will be a button named 'save to favorties'. This button will save the information to a div bellow named 'saved songs'. There also will be a search input field for Artists. In this search bar, you will be able to search an artist and it will give you the location of where the artists will play next. This is the second API.  -->

<!-- We are using the MusicBrainz API and the Bandisintown. -->

## Description
We created a web application that allows users to display a random activity or joke by clicking on the "Search An Activity" or "Have A Laugh" button respectively. Users can save an activity by clicking on the "Save Activity" button next to it. They can also delete a saved activity by clicking on the "Delete (red X)" button under "Search History."
