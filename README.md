# group-5-music-project



For our project, we decided to make a music application where you can search a song title and receive information about the song such as album, release date, length of song and more. This is our first API. When you are displayed with the information on the song card there will be a button named 'save to favorties'. This button will save the information to a div bellow named 'saved songs'. There also will be a search input field for Artists. In this search bar, you will be able to search an artist and it will give you the location of where the artists will play next. This is the second API. 

We are using the MusicBrainz API and the Bandisintown.

The tasks are seperated as follows, Santi will handle one API and saved storage, Jonathan will work on the CSS using Tailwind, Caitlin will be working on the other API (the music events one), Varney and Brian will be working on the HTML as well helping out with the two APIs. 

User Story -

WHEN I click on add to favorites, the song and its info will be saved at the bottom of the page
GIVEN a second input field
