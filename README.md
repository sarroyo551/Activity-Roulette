## Description
We created a web application called Activity Roulette that allows users to display a random activity or joke by clicking on the "Search An Activity" or "Have A Laugh" button respectively. Users can save an activity by clicking on the "Save Activity" button next to it. They can also delete a saved activity by clicking on the "Delete (red X)" button under "Search History."
