# group-5-music-project

<!-- For our project, we decided to make a music application where you can search a song title and receive information about the song such as album, release date, length of song and more. This is our first API. When you are displayed with the information on the song card there will be a button named 'save to favorties'. This button will save the information to a div bellow named 'saved songs'. There also will be a search input field for Artists. In this search bar, you will be able to search an artist and it will give you the location of where the artists will play next. This is the second API.  -->

<!-- We are using the MusicBrainz API and the Bandisintown. -->
